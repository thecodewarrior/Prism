/**
 * Type analyzers are the backend for many serializers, providing a format-agnostic way to implement the complex
 * process of extracting serializable data from an object and later integrating that data back in, either by modifying
 * an existing object or creating a new one.
 *
 * A type analyzer analyzes types and objects to determine the best way to get and set data. This often includes
 * decisions such as whether a new instance of the object is needed, and then if so what constructor to use. Some
 * serializers will change how they set data based on that data, such as not instantiating new objects if only mutable
 * fields were modified.
 *
 * Well-built analyzers should be thread safe, however the [TypeReader] and [TypeWriter] objects they return may not be.
